## Learn Terraform Expressions
In this tutorial, you will deploy a pre-generated webapp to EC2 instances behind an ELB. You will:
* use `locals` to assign your expressions to variables for reuse.
* use conditionals to declare if you want your configuration to contain multiple instances for high-availability.
* use the `splat` expression to return multiple private IPs in your network.
